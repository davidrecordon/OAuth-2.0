Internet-Draft     OAuth 2.0 User Experience Extension          Jul 2010


1.  Introduction

   This extension defines additional parameters for the client to
   include in OAuth 2.0 requests to the authorization server.  While
   there are not restrictions around which flows this extension can be
   used with, it will generally be used with user delegation flows.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Language Preference

   A client MAY provide the authorization server with information about
   an end-user's language preference.  The client includes the following
   URI query parameter when constructing its request to the end-user
   authorization endpoint URI:

   language
      OPTIONAL.  The user's preferred languages represented as a comma-
      separated list of [RFC5646] basic language ranges in descending
      priority order.  For example, the value "fr-CA,fr-FR,en-CA"
      represents the preference for French spoken in Canada, French
      spoken in France, followed by English spoken in Canada.

   This parameter SHOULD take precedence over both the HTTP Accept-
   Language header sent by the end-user's browser and any language
   preference inferred via IP address geolocation.


3.  Display

   OAuth 2.0 user delegation flows are designed to work across a wide
   variety of screen sizes, device types, and contexts.  The client MAY
   request a specific form factor of dialog from the authorization
   server based on what they feel is most appropriate.  The client
   includes the following URI query parameter when constructing its
   request to the end-user authorization endpoint URI:

   display
      OPTIONAL.  The most appropriate form factor for the authorization
      dialog.  If the parameter is included in the request, the value
      MUST be set to one of the following:

      page
         A full-page authorization screen (the default).

      popup
         A compact dialog optimized for modern web browser popup
         windows.

      touch
         A mobile-optimized dialog designed for modern smartphones such
         as Android and iPhone.

      wap
         An extremely compact dialog optimized for older mobile web
         browsers.


4.  Security Considerations

   No additional considerations beyond those described within the OAuth
   2.0 Protocol.
